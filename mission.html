      <h2>Why We Paddle</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission at the Dragon Boating Club is to inspire teamwork, health, and cultural appreciation through the sport of dragon boating. 
        We believe that paddling is more than just physical activity — it is a powerful way to bring people together, build lasting friendships, 
        and strengthen our connection to the water and to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are dedicated to creating an inclusive and supportive environment where everyone — regardless of age or experience — feels welcome. 
        From beginners to elite competitors, every paddler has a place in our boats.
      </p>

      <p>
        We aim to:
        <ul>
          <li>Encourage community involvement and team-building</li>
          <li>Promote physical and mental well-being through sport</li>
          <li>Honor the traditions and cultural roots of dragon boating</li>
          <li>Offer fair and fun competition for all skill levels</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        We paddle with passion, strength, and unity — on and off the water.
