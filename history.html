      <h2>Honoring Our Roots</h2>
      <p>
        Dragon boating has a rich and vibrant history that spans over two thousand years, originating in ancient China. 
        Traditionally, it was practiced to honor Qu Yuan, a loyal poet and statesman. His tragic story and the cultural rituals that followed 
        gave birth to the sport as a symbol of unity, remembrance, and strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our club carries this legacy forward. Founded in [your founding year], our journey began with a single boat, a group of friends, and 
        a shared love for the water. What started as a weekend activity quickly grew into a competitive and community-driven organization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, we have participated in numerous local and international festivals, hosted school outreach events, and helped new 
        paddlers discover their passion. We've expanded our training programs, formed partnerships with local councils, and supported 
        cultural festivals to educate others about dragon boating’s traditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, we continue to grow while staying true to our roots — paddling with pride, honoring history, and building a brighter future.
